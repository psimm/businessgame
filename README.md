Technical details

* The games uses ggplot2 with coord_equal() for its game board in a grid layout.
* Interactivity is realized with ggiraph::geom_point_interactive()
* The radioButtons() and ggiraph element are linked through an observeEvent() of the input$plot_selected element.
* The game primarily uses dplyr. Its state is tracked in a list of dataframes. The coding style could be described as pseudo-object oriented, as the state object is modified by various functions such as do_move() or buy().
